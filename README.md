# HTML FOR DOCX
Convert html to docx, this project is a fork from descontinued [pqzx/html2docx](https://github.com/pqzx/html2docx).

### How install

`pip install html-for-docx`

### Usage

The basic usage: Add HTML formatted to an existing Docx

```python
from html4docx import HtmlToDocx

parser = HtmlToDocx()
html_string = '<h1>Hello world</h1>'
parser.add_html_to_document(html_string, filename_docx)
```

You can use `python-docx` to manipulate the file as well, here an example

```python
from docx import Document
from html4docx import HtmlToDocx

document = Document()
new_parser = HtmlToDocx()

html_string = '<h1>Hello world</h1>'
new_parser.add_html_to_document(html_string, document)

document.save('your_file_name.docx')
```

Convert files directly

```python
from html4docx import HtmlToDocx

new_parser = HtmlToDocx()
new_parser.parse_html_file(input_html_file_path, output_docx_file_path)
```

Convert files from a string

```python
from html4docx import HtmlToDocx

new_parser = HtmlToDocx()
docx = new_parser.parse_html_string(input_html_file_string)
```

Change table styles

Tables are not styled by default. Use the `table_style` attribute on the parser to set a table style. The style is used for all tables.

```python
from html4docx import HtmlToDocx

new_parser = HtmlToDocx()
new_parser.table_style = 'Light Shading Accent 4'
```

To add borders to tables, use the `Table Grid` style:

```python
new_parser.table_style = 'Table Grid'
```

All table styles we support can be found [here](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/styles-understanding.html#table-styles-in-default-template).

### Why

My goal in forking and fixing/updating this package was to complete my current task at work, which involves converting HTML to DOCX. The original package lacked a few features and had some bugs, preventing me from completing the task. Instead of creating a new package from scratch, I preferred to update this one.
